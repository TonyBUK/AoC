# AoC
**Advent of Code Solutions**

The purpose of this repo is to provide a tutorial of sorts for each and every puzzle.  Initially I'll just be supplying Python, C and C++ solutions but more may be added in time.

The core idea is to not only show at least one way of solving each given problem, but also the trade-offs of each given language in doing this.

It's going to take a while to fully populate this, as whilst I have solved all (as of writing) 350 stars, I do want to take some time on each to re-factor.  Also, the majority of the code is in Python, so some effort is going to be needed (post cleanup) to port to C and C++.
