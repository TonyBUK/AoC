**Advent of Code Solutions**

The purpose of this repo is to provide a tutorial of sorts for each and every puzzle.  Initially I'll just be supplying Python, C and C++ solutions but more may be added in time.

The core idea is to not only show at least one way of solving each given problem, but also the trade-offs of each given language in doing this.

It's going to take a while to fully populate this, as whilst I have solved all (as of writing) 350 stars, I do want to take some time on each to re-factor.  Also, the majority of the code is in Python, so some effort is going to be needed (post cleanup) to port to C and C++.

One thing to be wary of, the solutions I've uploaded work for my particular environment with my inputs.  This may not be true for you.  I'll be interested to see if there's any issues along the lines of:
- My input works for you, but yours does not, which implies my solution is incomplete.
- My input doesn't work for you, which implies my solution is not portable.
